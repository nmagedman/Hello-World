A small rails intro task just to get into business:
Using ruby on rails, develop a simple web site:
	* Use git to manage your sources on github
	* It should include user authentication:
		* sign in (user / password hidden chars)
		* sign up - first login (double password for approval)
	* It should have a simple address book of all users including address,
	  first name, family name and telephone number.

Good luck!
